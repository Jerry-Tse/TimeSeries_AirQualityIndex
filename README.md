## Data Background
Orginial dataset is avaliable from [UCI website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality), which orginally derived from research made by De Vito, et al.(2008).  
  
Here are some hints for this datasets:  
* Data was recorded from 10.3.2004 to 04.4.2005 in an unknown city in Italy, the journal only mentioned the city as highly polluted.
* Data can be devided into PT and GT, where GT was collected from the nearby air quality monitor station, and PT was collected by the sensor right aside the road.
* Measures in GT contain unit, while PT has no unit recorded.
* GT includes CO, NOx, NO2, Bezene and NHMC(Non Metanic Hydrocarbons).
* PT includes CO, NOx, NO2, O3 and NHMC.
* All the missing value is replaced with -200.
